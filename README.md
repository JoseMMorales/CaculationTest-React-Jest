This Calculator app is a modern style app which provides a standard calculator functionality, it is written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) letting us split UI components, flexible, easy to update and maintain due to its modular structure. As state logic of these calculations and functionalities are quite complex, I decided to use [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) for a better optimization in performance for component. To make sure errors/bugs are being caught at build time, long before the app goes live we implement the project installing [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html), and finally unit testing is running thanks to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/tutorial-react) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for UI demonstrate that rendering is successfully done.
